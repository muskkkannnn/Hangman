# Day 07: Hangman
Created in Python.  

Hangman is a word-guessing game. The player has to guess a word chosen at random by the computer. The player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.   

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.
<br/><br/>
If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the program replaces it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the program adds one element of the hanging stick figure as a tally mark. Generally, the game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.
